Diving Championships Dataset for OWA Aggregation Operators and Multi-agent Decisions with N-Soft Sets.

In competitive diving, the scoring system of individual events works as follows [6]. There are k = 7 judges that award points from 0 (completely fail) to 10. Judges score in whole or half points thus G = {0, 0.5, 1, 1.5, . . . , 9.5, 10}, that we can for simplicity transform into G = {0,1,2,...,19,20} (we just divide by 0.5 each score). Thus N = 21 which means a fine grading. The judges score a dive based on four elements, namely, approach to the dive, take-off from the platform or spring- board, execution (flight through the air) and entry into water. Each diver performs a fixed number of dives. At the 2019 USA Diving Senior Na- tional Diving Championships held from May 19, 2019 to May 26, 2019, p = 12 divers performed q = 6 dives at the final of the Senior Men Platform competition [7].
